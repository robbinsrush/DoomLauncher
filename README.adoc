= Doom Launcher -= test

Doom Launcher is a _Doom_ frontend that serves as a database for
all your _Doom_ engine games, custom WADs, PK3s, and source ports.
Startup Doom Launcher to start having all your files in
one place. For convenience, you can download files from
https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/[/idgames] in the launcher,
similar to https://www.quaddicted.com/tools/quake_injector[Quake Injector].

Doom Launcher is packed with features, including:

* Direct download and metadata update from /idgames (through API).
* Add mods by drag and drop (ZIP including WAD/PK3/DEH/TXT).
* Automatic scraping of title, author, release date and description
from the included textfile.
* Importing screenshots directly from the sourceport into the database.
* Maintaining demos and savegames (DSG and ZDS supported).
* Scans files for map lump names (e.g. E4M3, MAP20, STR20).
* Add any sourceports to the database.
* Selecting specific files within a ZIP file.
* Tagging mods with custom unlimited colored tags.
* Shows play-statistics (killed monsters, collected items, play time).
Supported source ports includes ZDoom, PrBoom+, and CNDoom (Competition
Doom).
* Automatic daily database backups (SQLite database files).
* Create shortcuts to launch your favorite files.

Many more features are documented in the Help file. Please read that if
you have any concerns on some features or find out something you may not
be aware of.

Doom Launcher is written by Hobomaster22 in C# and requires .NET 4.5.

== Building Doom Launcher
To build Doom Launcher, download a copy of the repository and open up
the Solution file on Visual Studio (preferably using Visual Studio
14 toolsets). From there you can make your changes and test them
before contributing to the repository or tweaking the launcher
with your own personal preferences.

Doom Launcher currently supports Windows 7 or above, so Windows XP
won't work. Mac and Linux are unsupported.

== Development Tools

SQLite Browser. Great tool for viewing and editing the DoomLauncher.sqlite database: 
https://sqlitebrowser.org/

SonarLint. A great code analysis extension for Visual Studio. Highly recommended and used for most of Doom Launcher's development:
